    <p>A recipe from the actual streets of Rome!</p>
    <p>This Carbonara is bound to be some of the best you've had <br/>
        and it all comes from a little restaurant called 'Luciano-Cucina Italiana'</p>

    <h2 id="recipe">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>280g spaghetti (making sure to use a bronze cut; something like Dececco)</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>200g guanciale in 1cm cubes</li>
        <li>30g grana padano, grated</li>
        <li>20g pecorino romano, grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta according to package (make sure to follow the 'al dente' timing)</li>
        <li>Fry the guanciale cubes in order to make them crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.<br>
            Start on medium-high heat to get a nice sear then lower the temperature to finish them off.<br>
            RESERVE THE FAT!
        </li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, the grana padano, <br>
            and the pecorino romano, and the melted fat from the guanciale.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture rest</li>
        <li>Once pasta is cooked, combine with the mixture above with fresh ground black pepper, and the cubes of guanciale. <br>
            Make sure to vigorously mix them together so that you get an almost cream like sauce.</li>
        <li>Plate the pasta, and sprinkly some fresh pecorino romano and some more ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve. Making sure the pasta isn't too hot or too cold. Slightly above room temperature.</li>
