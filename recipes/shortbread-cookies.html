    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic that never gets old. These buttery golden shortbread <br />
        are so simple to make, delicious, and perfect for any occasion.</p>
    <p>Mix it up by pressing the dough into a skillet to bake, or pressing <br />
        it into a tart pan. You can also do easy variations by adding some <br />
        extra ingredients such as rose water, almonds, or even olives! </p>

    <h2 id="recipe">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. cold unsalted butter, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup or 100g sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup or 65g powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 tsp fine grain sea salt</li>
        <li>4 cups or 500g unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Makes 2-3 dozen meidum sized cookies.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the butter until soft. <br />
            Add the sugars and salt, and continue to mix until the texture is billowy and fluffy. <br />
            Scrape down the bowl once or twice along the way.</li>
        <li>Add the flour in two additions, mixing on low until just combined. <br />
            Turn out onto the countertop, form a uniform ball and press into a thick disc shape. <br />
            Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until completely chilled - at least a couple of hours. <br />
            You can also freeze the dough at this point for later use.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 350F with a rack in the center. 
            Roll the dough out 3/4-inch thick and use a cookie cutter or knife to create as many cookies as possible.<br /> 
            Gather any scraps, form a ball, re-roll and cut out remaining cookies. If you're making larger cookies, <br />
            use a fork or skewer to poke dots across the tops of the cookies. Arrange an inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheet. <br />
            Return the cookies to refrigerator, on the pan, for another 15-30 minutes. This will help reduce spread.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes, rotate the pan, and bake for another 10-15 minutes or until the cookies are deeply golden <br />
            where they touch the pan, and lightly golden on top. They should smell toast and amazing!</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, allow to cool for 5 minutes, and transfer to a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
